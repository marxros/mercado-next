description: Env vars and public assets migration guidance
---
## Environment Variables

- Copy required entries from `connect-alagoas/.env` to `mercado-next/.env.local`.
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for variables needed on the client. Others remain server-only.
- Access server env via `process.env.MY_VAR` in server contexts only. Do not import env into Client Components.
- Document required vars in `.env.example`.

## Public Assets

- Copy `connect-alagoas/public/**` into `mercado-next/public/**`.
- Reference assets with root-relative paths (e.g., `/placeholder.svg`).
- Prefer `next/image` for images to leverage optimization.
